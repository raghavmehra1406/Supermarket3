Supermarket Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing supermarket sales data to gain insights into sales trends, profit margins, and top-selling products.
The analysis includes calculating total sales, sales over time, and profit margins for different products, and visualizing these metrics to make the data easier to interpret.

Project Overview

This project provides insights into supermarket sales by using data analysis techniques in Python. The dataset includes details about sales transactions, including the item name, quantity sold, unit price, and wholesale price. Using this information, we can calculate total sales, identify top-selling products, track sales trends over time, and evaluate the profit margin for each product.


Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
seaborn: For advanced data visualizations (optional).

Usage

Open the Supermarket_Sales_Analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
Follow the steps to load the dataset, clean the data, and generate visualizations.
The notebook provides insights into:
Total Sales by Product
Sales Trends Over Time
Profit Margin by Product


Data Description

Item Name: Name of the product sold.
Quantity Sold (kilo): Amount of product sold (in kilograms).
Unit Selling Price (RMB/kg): Price of one kilogram of the product.
Wholesale Price (RMB/kg): Wholesale price per kilogram of the product.
Sale or Return: Indicates whether the transaction was a sale or return.
Loss Rate (%): Percentage of loss incurred in the transaction.


Visualizations:
Total Sales by Product: A bar chart showing the top 10 products by total sales.
Sales Trend by Month: A line chart depicting the sales trend over time.
Average Profit Margin by Product: A bar chart showing the top 10 products with the highest average profit margins.


Results

The analysis yields the following insights.

The top-selling products in the supermarket based on total sales.
The sales trend over time, which helps identify peak sales periods.
The profit margins for each product, showing which products provide the highest returns.


Note: 
You can modify the project to use other datasets or analyze sales from different supermarkets.
